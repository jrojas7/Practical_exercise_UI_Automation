## Search Feature Test

A brief introduction. This Cucumber project was created to test the "Search" feature of the "Mercado Libre" site.
Two test cases were created, and it is possible to configure their execution from the "MainRunner" class (using tags, parallel mode).

It is possible to configure the browser for executions from the "config.properties" file. The available browsers are:
- chrome
- firefox
- edge

Finally, it is possible to see a Cucumber HTML report for test case executions, with the respective screenshot in case a test case fails, in the following path:
- target/cucumber
